  <div ><h3>Welcome to sync'd gaze!</h3><p>You're reading my first blog post on a site that I built myself.</p><p><figure data-title=""><img src="break.gif" alt="break" title=""></figure></p><p>This is site was my idea of making myself more presentable to people outside of my normal circle and to test out technologies/stacks that I haven't used. It also serves to help me get better with writing, which I am awful at.</p><p>I tried to figure out what tech stack should I use, of course I looked into javascript, react, and the normal things you would use to build a website.</p><p>Others might enjoy those technologies but they do not comfort me and I am not looking to shill that for $$$.</p><p>The true idea is to find a stack that I enjoy writing in. Comfort and ease of use is subjective but this is something that I am working on for myself.</p><h3>Jumping on the band wagaon</h3><p>I tried to get on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGfQu0bQTKc">Rust</a> hype train for this project. I do actually like the language but not for working on my site. Rust has so many libraries and opinonated <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">ones</a>, that I had trouble deciding. Ended up trying <a href="https://www.leptos.dev">Leptos</a>...</p><p>The setup to leptos is awesome and the ramp up was great but anything above boilerlplate made it difficult for me to grasp.</p><p>It felt overly complex just for a pretty basic website. I am not trying to win any awards over here.</p><p>I definitely hit a skill issue, no lying about it because I am both a web and rust <strong>NOOB</strong></p><h3>Starting at square one</h3><p>Taking a step back, I decided to just start this site with pure html/css sprinkled with a small library from <a href="https://bigsky.software/">bigsky.software</a> called <a href="https://missing.style/">missing.style</a>. It was fun and poking around with developer tools on sites I enjoyed, giving me a great learning experience for styling and concept ideas.</p><p>During this time I have been lurking on discord & twitch especially on all my favorite language's channels. One day there was a notifications on zig's channel from <code>Kristoff</code>, the VP of community for <a href="https://ziglang.org/">ZSF</a>, introducing a new project that would be up my alley, <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine">Zine</a>.</p><p><code>Zine</code> is a static site generator that allowed me the best opportunities:</p><ul><li><p>Using zig for every project</p></li><li><p>Being able to make my site quickly (hot reloading feature)</p></li><li><p>No JAVASCRIPT</p></li><li><p>Using HTML/CSS</p></li><li><p>Not convoluted</p></li><li><p>Did I mention no JAVASCRIPT</p></li></ul><p>The hardest part of zine is figuring out templating and best way to make reusable templates.</p><p>I do wish Zine had:</p><ul><li><p>markdown files syntax corresponds also to some html tags (i.e. markdown headers to H<n> tags)</p></li><li><p>ability to recurse any folder as root for a page.</p></li></ul><p>Zine in reality has been nice and the DX for it has helped me iterate quick enough.</p><p>I do need to play around to see if I can inject zig code directly into my current files, which would add the ability for me to have it more interactive.</p><p>The only other problem I run into now is, how do I want my website to look besides the content. This is were it will take time to get what I want out in the public.</p><p>My main thing is <code>simplicity</code> and <code>ease</code>.</p><p>This is a good stopping point for the time being. I will be posting updates as well as things about music and technology in general.</p><p>Thanks</p></div>
