# Sync'd Gaze

A website hosting all my thoughts about `Technology` and `music`

The goal is to try to make a website and be able to start writing. I have no clue about web
development besides basic knowledge and what I hear from various media platforms. 

## To Develop

Run the following command and open your browser to the address being served. 

```zig
 nix develop
 zig build serve
```

## Goals
 - Leverage languages I love :heart_on_fire:
 - Simple
 - No JS
 - Focus on content

## TODO

- [X] Basic templating
- [X] Markdown parsing
- [ ] Typst parsing
- [X] Hosted Github pages
- [ ] Get deaf.audio domain
- [ ] Host it somewhere outside of github
- [ ] SSR
- [ ] HTMX for the win

## Research 

1/28/2024
Currently I have started to use `Kristoff's Zine` it is a static website generator made in zig.
It has some pain-points but seems real easy and fun to use. I still don't know how to generate a 
list for the notes and how to have each content pick up styling.
