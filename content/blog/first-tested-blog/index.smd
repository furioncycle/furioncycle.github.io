### Welcome to sync'd gaze!  

You're reading my first blog post on a site that I built myself.

![break](break.gif)

This is site was my idea of making myself more presentable to people outside of my normal circle and to test out technologies/stacks that I haven't used. It also serves to help me get better with writing, which I am awful at.

I tried to figure out what tech stack should I use, of course I looked into javascript, react, and the normal things you would use to build a website.

Others might enjoy those technologies but they do not comfort me and I am not looking to shill that for $$$.

The true idea is to find a stack that I enjoy writing in. Comfort and ease of use is subjective but this is something that I am working on for myself.


### Jumping on the band wagaon 

I tried to get on the [Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGfQu0bQTKc) hype train for this project. I do actually like the language but not for working on my site. Rust has so many libraries and opinonated [ones](https://www.arewewebyet.org/), that I had trouble deciding. Ended up trying [Leptos](https://www.leptos.dev)...

The setup to leptos is awesome and the ramp up was great but anything above boilerlplate made it difficult for me to grasp.

It felt overly complex just for a pretty basic website. I am not trying to win any awards over here.

I definitely hit a skill issue, no lying about it because I am both a web and rust **NOOB**

### Starting at square one

Taking a step back, I decided to just start this site with pure html/css sprinkled with a small library from [bigsky.software](https://bigsky.software/) called [missing.style](https://missing.style/). It was fun and poking around with developer tools on sites I enjoyed, giving me a great learning experience for styling and concept ideas. 

During this time I have been lurking on discord & twitch especially on all my favorite language's channels. One day there was a notifications on zig's channel from `Kristoff`, the VP of community for [ZSF](https://ziglang.org/), introducing a new project that would be up my alley, [Zine](https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine). 

`Zine` is a static site generator that allowed me the best opportunities:

- Using zig for every project
- Being able to make my site quickly (hot reloading feature)
- No JAVASCRIPT
- Using HTML/CSS
- Not convoluted
- Did I mention no JAVASCRIPT

The hardest part of zine is figuring out templating and best way to make reusable templates. 

I do wish Zine had: 

- markdown files syntax corresponds also to some html tags (i.e. markdown headers to H<n> tags) 
- ability to recurse any folder as root for a page.

Zine in reality has been nice and the DX for it has helped me iterate quick enough.

I do need to play around to see if I can inject zig code directly into my current files, which would add the ability
for me to have it more interactive.

The only other problem I run into now is, how do I want my website to look besides the content. This is were it will take time to get what I want out in the public. 

My main thing is `simplicity` and `ease`.

This is a good stopping point for the time being. I will be posting updates as well as things about music and technology in general. 

Thanks
